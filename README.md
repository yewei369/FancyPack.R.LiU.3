# FancyPack.R.LiU.3
Euclidean and Dijkstra functions

The package includes two functions: 
*Euclidean function for finding GCD of two integers;
*Dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest route, given a cost table of data frame and a numerical source point. Output is a vector of distance for all nodes acorrding to requirement, but it is possible to genereate the shortest route as well which is stored in first elements of list "nodes"
